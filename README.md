## Description
This is the project of group-15 for the course CS685. In this project, we have analysed the data available on [MyAnimeList](https://myanimelist.net/) and tried to get some insights related to the growth of anime over time, genres, studios, etc. Along with that, we have also built anime recommendation systems using different models to provide both content based and collaborative filtering based recommendations to users.
